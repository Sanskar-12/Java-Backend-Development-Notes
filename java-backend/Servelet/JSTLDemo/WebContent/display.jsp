JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library) is a collection of tag
 libraries that simplify JSP (JavaServer Pages) development by providing
  standard functionalities such as iteration, conditionals, internationalization, database access, and XML processing
  It eliminates the need for embedding Java code inside JSP files by using custom tags.
